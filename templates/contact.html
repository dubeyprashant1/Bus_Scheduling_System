                <h2>System Overview</h2>
                <p>The Automated Bus Scheduling and Route Management System is an advanced tool developed to streamline and optimize the operations of the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC). By combining the power of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), real-time data analytics, and machine learning algorithms, the system aims to improve the overall efficiency of the public transport system, ensuring timely bus schedules, optimized routes, and a better user experience for commuters.</p>
                <p>In the world of urban mobility, traffic congestion, inefficient scheduling, and poorly managed routes are some of the significant challenges that hinder the overall efficiency of public transport. Our solution is designed to tackle these challenges head-on, providing a reliable, cost-effective, and scalable system that can adapt to the dynamic nature of urban transport.</p>
                <p>Key features include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Linked Duty Scheduling:</strong> Ensures crew assignments stay consistent for shifts, improving accountability and reducing the possibility of errors in scheduling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unlinked Duty Scheduling:</strong> Allows crews to change shifts efficiently while managing rest periods, handling reassignments, and ensuring compliance with labor regulations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Route Management:</strong> Provides an interactive map that helps managers visualize routes, manage bus assignments, and plan new routes with minimal overlaps, ensuring more effective coverage and reduced delays.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
